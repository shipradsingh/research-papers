1. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14988 Quantum Multi-Armed Bandits and Stochastic Linear Bandits Enjoy Logarithmic Regrets
    <details><summary>Quick Summary</summary>
    This paper presents quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits (MAB) and stochastic linear bandits (SLB), achieving $O(\text{poly}(\log T))$ regret bounds, a major improvement over the classical $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds. By employing quantum reward oracles and the Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, these algorithms enable faster reward estimation, thereby enhancing the exploration-exploitation balance. Specifically, QUCB (for MAB) and QLinUCB (for SLB) adapt upper confidence bound techniques with quantum-stage-based learning, yielding regret scaling as $O(n \log T)$ for MAB and $O(d^2 \log^{5/2} T)$ for SLB. This work represents the first quantum speedup in bandit regret minimization, with implications for quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning.

2. https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08561 A Smoothed Analysis of Online Lasso for the Sparse Linear Contextual Bandit Problem
    <details><summary>Quick Summary</summary>
    This paper introduces a smoothed analysis framework for sparse linear contextual bandits, where parameter $\theta$ is sparse, using an "Online Lasso" approach. By incorporating minor random perturbations to adversarially generated data, the authors achieve an efficient regret bound of $O(\sqrt{kT \log d})$ without complex preprocessing. This method enhances model stability and error minimization, even in high-dimensional and adversarial contexts. The results hold for both low and high-dimensional cases, showing practical applications in sequential decision-making scenarios like personalized recommendations and online experimentation.
